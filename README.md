# Visualizer for first-order ODEs

This is a visualizer for first-order ODEs and simulates solution for given initial values.

Launch Command: `python3 -m ode_visualizer`
Or use the released .pyz file: `python3 ode_visualizer.pyz`

## How to use

- Type in the fist-order ODE: express dy/dx in terms of x and y
- Drag the graph with left buttom
- Double click the graph to add initial points
- Right click the graph to clear the solutions
- Right click the textbox to clear the inputs
- Scroll to zoom
